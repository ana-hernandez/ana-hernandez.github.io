                                        ResilientEntrepreneurs was created by social entrepreneurship students at USC’s Marshall School of Business. After hearing 14 entrepreneurs share their journey, we’ve got entrepreneurship all figured out. The key to successful entrepreneurship is resilience - and we’re blogging about it to help you become more resilient while you develop your entrepreneurial instinct. Just follow our blog to learn about the six steps to building resilience and how to master the affiliated rules of the road that you need to embark on your path to success!

                                        Our blog features ‘Resilients’ (i.e. entrepreneurs identified to have exemplified the quality of resilience) to illustrate how different situations require resiliency while navigating the rules of the entrepreneurial road. Entrepreneurship is a complex endeavor and many different paths can lead to success - rough roads, precarious paths, windy ways, and rocky routes are all part of the journey and it takes resilience to keep moving forward to reach the light at the end of the tunnel. We observed resilience in individuals, teams, and businesses, and identified resilience in emotional, mental, and social capacities. Resilience is a quality that these individuals exhibited in their journey. Our featured entrepreneurs are associated with one or more of the following Steps to Become More Resilient; it’s also important to hone your entrepreneurial intuition so we’ve matched up each step of building resilience with rules to live by.

                                        Resiliency within a team starts from the very beginning - you need to have the right people in your team in order to be successful; you need a  good team with the right attitude, commitment, perseverance and support, especially in times of adversity. Furthermore, once you have your team, you need to build a foundation based on trust, commitment and accountability. With these three aspects, you will have a team that will always be there for the organization and will never give up.  Our first step towards becoming more resilient is “Building a good team”, which can only be done if you hire people with a positive attitude. We provide evidence for our recommendation on how to hire your team and present two cases on how entrepreneurs dealt with team resiliency when building their teams.  
                                        </p><br>
                                      <p>
                                        After interviewing 127 candidates for your start-up, you have finally narrowed it down to two great ones. On one hand, you have an individual with previous experience and the skills needed for the position; on the other hand, you have an individual with a positive and go-getter attitude, but lacks the experience needed.
                                      </p><br>

                                      <h3>Which individual should you hire?</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        The first thing that may come to mind is to hire the individual that has the “right skill-set” necessary to perform the job, as you may believe that s/he will adapt easier to the position. However, even the most talented and smart individuals fail on the job because of their negative attitudes. Companies that do not take into account attitude when hiring will most likely have higher turnover rates than those that do take attitude into account.

                                      <h3>Want some proof?</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        Mark Murphy conducted a <a href="https://www.business.com/articles/hiring-for-attitude-over-experience-what-the-numbers-show/" target="_blank"> research study</a> based on 20,000 new hires. These were the results:

                                      <img src="images/img1-p1.png" height="400" width="500"><br><br>

                                      <h3>Surprised? Want even more proof?</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        Two entrepreneurs shared their hiring process experiences with ResilientEntrpreneurs. On one hand we have Robert Kiraz, owner of Vokle, who hired based on skills, but the end result was a complete disaster. On the other hand, we have Marc Mitchell, owner of Lootsie, who hired based on attitude and had a very positive end result. 
                                      </p><br>

                                      <h3>Case 1: What to do</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        Marc Mitchell, who started Lootsie in 2014, shared with ResilientEntrepreneurs his educational and professional background which exemplified resiliency all along the way.  Through his experience, he realized the importance of creating a “good company DNA”. He mentioned the importance of having people in the team that “believe in you, your company and your product” because those are the ones that will always be there to support you even in the most difficult situations. This was the reason behind him being so involved in the hiring process for Lootsie. Mitchell was faced with the dilemma of whether to hire the son, Tim, of one of his investors. He was able to utilize the knowledge gained from his previous experience and decided to hire because he believed that “a good attitude can make up for lack of experience”. After making the decision to hire Tim, even though he knew that this could result in lots of controversy within the company, he decided to be honest with his team, and talked about Tim’s background. This shows how important it is for Mitchell not only to hire people with a positive attitude, but also, to maintain good communication and trust among the team.  
                                      </p><br>

                                      <h3>Case 2: What not to do</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        Robert Kiraz did the exact opposite - his main mission was to hire someone that had the “right skill- set” necessary in order to get his idea going. This was Kiraz’s worst decision. Kenneth, his hire, did not only create a negative atmosphere in the organization, but he also negatively harmed the exit strategy for Vokle.  This is an example of the statistic that we just mentioned - Kenneth was part of the 46% of individuals that fail due to a negative attitude. In conclusion, someone with an excellent education, great background and experience may fail in a job if s/he has the wrong attitude. On the other hand, someone who is inexperienced and doesn’t have the required skills may be very successful if s/he has a positive and go-getter attitude.  
                                      </p><br>

                                      <h3>Good attitudes for team resiliency</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        If hiring for attitude wasn’t at the core of your recruiting strategies, then we hope we made it clear enough to make it a priority in your future business decisions. It is very important that you hire individuals that will add value to your organization and that will help you be resilient!

                                        Is there anyone at your company that contributes to the team by his/her positive attitude? Have you ever hired for attitude over skills? If so, share your story with us in the comments!

                                        Have you ever been in a negative situation that you do not know how to get out of? Have you ever been involved in a problem that is completely out of your control? Have you ever feared to take a decision because you are afraid of the consequences? If your answer to any of these questions is “no”, you are probably not from this planet! Every single human being has experienced a moment in their lives when they are in the middle of a situation that they just do not have control of - and it is completely normal, it is part of the challenge that life puts us through in order to make us stronger. So, we may have no control of the actual problem, but we do have control of how we approach and act towards the problem and what we get out of it. Knowing how to get yourself out of a negative situation is called active thinking, and it is the second step in order to become a resilient leader.   
                                        </p><br>
                                      <p>
                                        It is not easy to shift to active thinking, sometimes it takes several bumps in the road to know how to act during times of difficulty. According to the book, <a href="https://daringtolivefully.com/be-more-resilient" target="_blank"></a> 14 ways to be more resilient by Marelisa Fabrega, in order to shift to active thinking, there are some questions you can ask yourself:
                                        <ul>
                                          <li>How can I control the problem so it doesn’t get worse?</li>
                                          <li>What can I do to limit the scope or the duration of the problem?</li>
                                          <li>How can I reduce the potential downside of this adverse event?</li>
                                          <li>What aspects can I control?</li>
                                          <li>How can I best respond?</li>
                                        </ul>

                                      </p><br>
                                      <p>
                                        If you have never asked these questions when facing a problem, don’t worry, I haven’t either… so you are not alone! Even entrepreneurs with big ideas that have a certain amount of success did not think of these questions when facing a critical decision in their ventures. Let’s analyze this in more detail using the case about Robert Kiraz and Vokle from last week’s blog
                                      </p> <br>
                                      <p>
                                        Robert Kiraz graduated from USC in 2008, [pretty smart guy huh?!], and he had a brilliant idea in which through a new coverage forum, users would be able to interact and chat about timely topics in new and innovative ways. Kiraz and his partner had the idea, but they didn’t have the technical skills to make this idea a reality. After several interviews, they finally hired Kenneth who, even though had the right skill-set, didn’t have a very good reputation for filing lawsuits. Three months into the project, Kiraz and his partner started noticing Kenneth’s volatile and divisive personality. Kenneth's negative personality went on and on for several more months, however, Kiraz decided not to fire him until after 17 months. Kiraz explained to ResilientEntrepeneurs that the main reason behind him not firing Kenneth at the very beginning was because of all the projects he was in charge of and the timings in which he had to deliver the project. Kiraz believed that Kenneth was essential for the project to be delivered, not knowing that the problems he would end up with in the long run would be much bigger than if he just fired Kenneth once he felt he was not right for the team.
                                      </p> <br>
                                      <p>
                                        So, did Kiraz use active or passive thinking? We may argue that it was somehow in between.  Let's review his actions with our questions:
                                          <ul>
                                          <li>Did Kiraz control the problem so it didn’t get worse? Kiraz tried talking to Kenneth about his attitude during the first months into the project; however, he kind of gave up in the end and just focused on the fact that the project had to be completed on time. </li>
                                          <li>Did Kiraz limit the scope or the duration of the problem? He definitely did not! He waited 17 months in order to fire Kenneth!</li>
                                          <li>Did Kiraz reduce the potential downside of this adverse event? No, he didn’t! At the end, not only was Kenneth gone, but also the company culture was completely toxic, the CTO left right after Kenneth was fired, and these events completely ruined Vokle’s exit strategy.</li>
                                          <li>What aspects did Kiraz control? He was definitely trying to control the project so that it was presented on time to the investors. He cared less about the toxic environment that was getting built into the company culture.</li>
                                          <li>How could Kiraz best responded to this situation? How could he have been resilient? Fired Kenneth at month 6! But if he wanted to be even more of an active thinker, Kiraz should have waited longer to hire an engineer. In other words, he should have “Hired Slow and Fired Fast”</li>
                                        </ul>
                                      </p><br>

                                      <p>
                                        When we talk about “hire slow, fire fast” we are not referring to taking several months to bring someone on the team, or to fire someone based on a small (fixable) issue/problem. But as entrepreneurs - or aspiring entrepreneurs - it is essential that you are very careful about who you hire and who you let stay around in your team. Establishing a good team not only helps you develop a healthy company culture, but it also contributes in sustaining conversations about funding, helps everyone work together in order to deliver the product fast and at its best quality, and enables the CEO to have the trust to delegate several of his responsibilities.

                                        Several business owners I know fire very slowly. Why so? We surveyed 24 business owners and the answers were: 
                                        <ol>
                                          <li>They think/hope things will get better</li>
                                          <li>Their experience/knowledge is crucial for the organization (Kiraz was included in this survey btw)</li>
                                        </ol>
                                      </p><br>

                                      <p>
                                        However, it is important to understand that employees with negative attitudes will never change, especially at their own will. So <b>if you don’t have a strategy in place on how to help people change attitudes, the best way to go is firing the ones that are not a good mix for the team</b>. Because if not, you have permitted the employee to have control of your resources, information, and sometimes even your team. This is what happened to Kiraz - Kenneth ruined the company culture, influenced the CTO which ended up in his departure from the company, and resulted in Vokle losing thousands of dollars when it exited.

                                        Another common mistake is hiring fast. By hiring too fast you may end up hiring someone that may give you an immediate solution, but will cost you long term consequences. Robert Half says in his quote: “Time spent on hiring, is time well spent”. I agree! I believe Kiraz rushed in taking the decision of hiring Kenneth because he was so desperate to get his project going that he did not even think about what type of company culture he wanted for Vokle.

                                        Kiraz is not a good example of being resilient in situations that require tough decision-making, so be the opposite of him. The moment you start thinking that someone in your team is not a good fit for the company anymore, you are probably months too late. Fire them immediately!

                                                                I can totally relate with Kiraz. I once hired an IT manager for my company and it took me over two years to fire him. He started really well, he delivered all the projects on time, and was nice to people, well, I think he pretended he was nice. Then, after 7 months of being in the company he started screaming at people, not delivering projects on time, and he was always late. I had several talks with him, and at the very beginning it did work, but after a week or so everything was the same again. I was very afraid to fire him because I really thought he could steal company information or damage the servers; however, little did I know that having him in the company was even worse. He created a very bad working environment, several people in the organization left because of how mean and rude he was. After hundreds of complaints I finally decided to let him go, and believe me, it was the best decision I’ve ever made.

                                        What role does passion play in your life? Are you a passionate person or do you have passions about specific things? Passion gives us purpose. Passion leads us to live meaningful lives. For an entrepreneur, passion comes in many forms - money, solutions, products, industry, growth, to make an impact - and drives us forward. The difference between Resilients and everyone else is that Resilients take charge of their passion. You can become more resilient to roadblocks by taking control of your passion to drive your business forward. ResilientEntrepreneurs sat down with two of our favorite entrepreneurs to find out how they used their passion to navigate their startups. Scroll down to see what we learned!

                                        People often link passion to career or passion with their purpose in life. But we also often think of being passionate about something - the idea of passion for a product, industry, or cause. Scott Porter, co-founder of Reverse Charades, and Jedd Gold, co-founder of Tandem Learning, give us their sides of the story. 
                                      </p><br>

                                      <h3>Taking charge on self-fulfillment</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        Listen to Jedd Gold for about 5 minutes and it’s easy to make out that he aspires to self-improvement. His language is full of allusions to betterment - ownership, hard work, success, growth, opportunity - and his life lessons embrace growth on a professional and personal level. If you have an intense passion for growth, it’s easy to take charge of how you choose to grow; Gold routinely left jobs that no longer challenged or interested him - even his own startup. He had no passion for education software and considered his exit from Tandem Learning from the perspective of what he could accomplish - ticking off the liquidation checkbox of entrepreneurial achievements, moving forward in his career path, continuing to build his knowledge base and skillsets. Thus far, Gold has been successful in fulfilling his passion, and he has done so by being active about it. Since Tandem Learning, Gold has gone on to co-found Tastemaker Mom and Artkive. Rather than calling him out for being a serial entrepreneur, we prefer to think of his seeming restlessness as actively staying the course on personal growth.

                                      <h3>Taking charge on new experiences</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        Scott Porter is another type of serial entrepreneur, driven by his passion for experiences. Driven by a thirst for new experiences, you may be creating businesses to give yourself (and others) more life experiences - to do many things you like rather than focus on one thing you love. For Porter, the intensity of passion was spread out over different facets. His dip into the entrepreneurial pool with Reverse Charades wasn’t enough to make him leave a stable and secure full-time job immediately, but it did stir up a desire to try new things. Porter went on to found five startups in the span of 8 years, thriving on his passion for doing something new. His startups have no clear link to each other - from board games to aviation to single humanitarians to basketball to artsy foods. Reading this list portrays Porter as unfocused and aimless, but his passion for new life experiences is what drives him. And there’s nothing wrong with that!</p><br>

                                        <p>So go on and figure out what type of passion you have and once you do, CHARGE!</p><br>

                                        One of the biggest challenges that CEO’s face every single day is staying ahead of change. Change affects every aspect and department of a business and if you don’t know how to handle change, you should start planning your exit strategy. Change is not easy - you need to have a resilient attitude in order to face it. So, how can a CEO stay ahead of change against an unknown future and have the resilient attitude needed? Simple. Build a continuous learning culture in your team!

                                      <p>
                                        When we talk about continuous learning, it not only means reading the latest news from different industries or constantly reviewing over and over again your old books from college. What we mean with continuous learning goes beyond that: learning new abilities and skills in order to apply them during difficult times, listening to what your customers’ wants and needs are in order to innovate and always be ahead of the game, and listening to your employees as they are the ones that will help you develop and deliver what your customers want. Being a good listener has several benefits. It helps you establish important relationships with clients, bond with your customers as you know what they want, and engage and maintain your employees’ happiness (or at least make them feel that you understand them). All of this will help you build trust, which, of course, will lead to increased cohesiveness and productivity.

                                        Tn his book, <a href="http://jackiehuba.com/books/creating-customer-evangelist" target="_blank">Creating Customer Evangelists </a>. Ben McConnell mentions “To know what customers are thinking, ask them!” Whether you are meeting one-on-one with people, or through social media, it doesn’t matter! You need to reach them in any way possible in order to know what they are thinking, and for them to feel you care about them.

                                      <p>
                                        So, do you want to learn ways in which you can better listen to your customers? Let’s learn from the experts. The following are three entrepreneurs’ insights that will help you in understanding what your customers want.

                                      </p><br>

                                      <h3>1.  What is the problem you are trying to solve?</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        Henry Ford once said (this is still debatable, we can’t assure that Ford actually said it), “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses”; this was during the time when horses were the primary method of transportation. This means that even though sometimes you may ask your customers what they want, they may not even know what it is yet - they will indicate the problem and you will have to figure out what the solution is. Companies need to think beyond their customers’ ability to specifically say what they really want. 
                                      </p><br>

                                      <p>
                                        An outstanding entrepreneur that was able to identify an innovative solution to a problem was Asa Nordgren, co-founder of Trice Imaging Healthcare.  Statistics show that 800 women die everyday, 90% of these women are in underserved or rural markets, and 70% of women could be saved if they had access to diagnostic expertise. Based on Ford’s quote, looking at this problem, clients would have asked to have more clinics nearby, or have access to transportation that would take them to an expert that could give them an immediate solution in case they have a problem. However, after attending a World Economic forum, and realizing that there was so much that could be done through technology in healthcare, Nordgren and her partners decided to think outside the box and create a clinical tool so “quality healthcare can be provided to anyone, anywhere, anytime.”
                                      </p><br>

                                      <p>
                                        This is a clear example of how after Nordgren and her partners identified the problem they wanted to tackle, and by diving in on how the industry worked, they were able to create a solution that is now benefiting thousands of individuals that need access to quality healthcare. Entrepreneurs need to understand that the key is not just establishing a business, they need to solve problems. Just as Amazon made online buying and selling easier, and Ford made automobiles affordable to millions, Nordgren is making quality healthcare accessible. So when you are thinking about establishing a business, think about what problem you can help to solve. If you are able to identify what your potential customers’ real problem is - not only what they are literally saying - then you can look into different opportunities to create products or services that will serve those customers. 

                                      </p><br>

                                      <h3>2. Social Media as a must</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        You need to use social media not only as a marketing tool for building your brand image, but also as a platform to learn about what your customers’ and potential customers’ wants and needs are, as well as how they are able to express themselves.  Constantly interact with your customers - monitor what they are saying about you and about the industry itself. For example, Caue Suplicy, co-founder of Barnana, is very active on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/barnana/" target="_blank">social media </a>. He posts daily on facebook about their products, their different locations, as well as information about food waste and environmental sustainability. This kind of information keeps the customers and potential customers up to date on the organization, and shows how important the environment is to Barnana. In their Instagram, Barnana is constantly interacting with its followers, for example, they use different hashtags in order to interact with their audience, and create trends such as: “Snap a photo and use the hashtag #bananacar for a chance to win a ride in the car.” Suplicy mentioned that because of their low budget to collect data, deliver surveys, or do focus-groups, he has to use resources like social media as much as possible to reach more audiences. Smart, huh?! Social media is a great way to expose your business, especially if you are low on budget. 
                                      </p><br>

                                      <h3>3. Interact with your customers and potential customers</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        One of the best ways to find out what your customers want is by physically interacting with them. There is a lot of valuable information that you can get from one-on-one listening - what the customers think about the product or service you are offering or how you need to pivot to address customer desires. In-person interaction can create an emotional connection with your brand, which makes a greater impact than offering your service through email or snail mail. Some ways you can reach your customers:
                                        <ul>
                                          <li><b>Surveys:</b> this is one of the most widely used tools in order to get customer feedback. Phone or in-person surveys  are highly recommended, in order to get valuable feedback. If you plan to do surveys make sure to include open-ended questions and not only the typical rating surveys. With this, you are able to understand the reason behind the rating, and replicate what you did right, and change what you did wrong.</li>
                                          <li><b>Observation:</b> This is one of the best ways to know your customer’s behavior. An entrepreneur that uses observation as a key to successfully gathering data about her clients is Elvina Beck, owner of PodShare. She mentions the importance of “eating your own dog’s food”. She puts this into practice by actually living in and experiencing the PodShare. By doing so, she has been able to implement new features in the buildings in order to satisfy the needs of the clients.</li>
                                          <li><b>Focus Groups:</b> Gather your best customers and have them give you direct feedback about your product or service. Believe me, they are going to be very honest, and that information is going to be very valuable for the future of the company. If you don’t have the resources to get everyone together, there are several online tools (e.g. WebEx) that you can use to get everyone connected through the web.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                      </p><br>

                                      <p>
                                        If you want to stay on top of the game and create a continuous learning environment in your company, you must stay connected with your customers. Paying attention to your customers will lead you to success. And we know you want to be successful!

                                        Resiliency in an individual, in a team, and in a company is made stronger with a broad network of personal and professional relationships. Dealing with adversities, growing, pivoting, and achieving goals are made all the more possible with a strong support network. As obvious as this may be, networking is so important that we couldn’t leave it off our list of steps to becoming more resilient! And with that, you have step 5 to becoming more resilient - get connected and cultivate your relationships.  
                                        </p><br>
                                      <p>
                                        Networking is so important that the true value of an MBA is considered to be the networks that are built, not necessarily the knowledge that is gained from the classroom. The value of networks can also be seen in other degrees - med school, law school - and networks are necessary for success in multiple careers (business, politics). This week we’re featuring the importance of networks in two different contexts - the worlds of entrepreneurship and politics. 
                                      </p><br>

                                      <h3>The Networking Circle</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        When you’re starting up your business, who are the first people you go to? Although you may not think of your friends, family, and colleagues as your ‘network’ because those relationships are more personal, this is your inner circle. The greater your inner circle, the more options you’ll have in your outer circle - the networks of your friends, family, and colleagues. Finally, the outermost circle is beyond your current network - but not unreachable. With social networking services nowadays, it’s much easier to get in with your outermost circle.
                                      </p><br>

                                      <h3>The importance of networks</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        So far we’ve talked only about entrepreneurs and how they have been resilient in the face of adversity - Mitchell, Gold, Porter, Nordgren, Suplicy, Beck (see steps 1-4 for more info!) - but we’re adding to our mix of Resilients and introducing to you U.S. Representative Nanette Barragan, our honorary non-entrepreneur, as an exemplary case of the importance of networking. A grad of USC’s law school (go Trojans!), Nanette chose to make a career change and enter the world of politics. While a lot of her success can be attributed to her inner strength, resilience, strategic decision-making, and drive, she would have had a lot more barriers to making it if she didn’t have a network to lean on. Fundraising was such a large part of her campaigning that she had to rely on her inner, outer, and outermost circles - and beyond - to raise money. Not only that, but she had to connect with people who were outside of her network in order to make fundraising work for her. This networking skill - being able to approach new people and connect with them - is so important in the world of business. You can’t be a business person without it!</p><br>

                                        <p>What about examples of entrepreneurs who have relied on their networks to start up their businesses? 
                                        </p><br>

                                      <h3>The Value of (Ivy League) Connections</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        As a Harvard graduate, Anna Redmond - co-founder of Hippo Reads - began her business with a fellow Harvard alumna after realizing that they shared perspectives on how academia should be. The Harvard alumni drew on their networks that they made from their university to start-up the company - which only led to bigger and wider networks. Would Redmond and her partner have been able to start-up as quickly without those networks? Highly doubtful. 
                                      </p><br>

                                      <p>
                                        Keeping with the networking theme, academia is a vast network that is its own little bubble and Redmond aims to build on this by connecting academics and their target audience through the Hippo network.  
                                      </p><br>

                                      <h3>The Value of Knowing the Right People</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        Elvina Beck, founder of PodShare, knew just the right person to get her business to the forefront of people’s awareness. She claims a religious fervor about ‘making friends’ and her contact at TechCrunch featured a humorous PodShare video - after which, PodShare exploded. Without the article, PodShare would have had to work that much harder to get the funding and interest to build the community that Beck was looking for - a very specific niche attracted to a lack of privacy, a lot of social interaction, and travelers on a budget who don’t mind sharing with other people (or lonely travelers!).   
                                      </p><br>

                                      <h3>Ask anyone!</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        But don’t take our word for it - approach any successful, up-and-coming, startup, or student business person and you’ll see that some aspect of their business was achieved through networking. Networking is a two-sided road and you have to return the favor or collect at a later date. Building your network strengthens your business’s resiliency by accumulating an armory of favors, aid, and partnerships that you can draw on (and add to) as you develop and grow your company. So get going and start networking!  
                                      </p><br>

                                        Resiliency is not only about being able to recover and deal with adversities, but it is also the ability to be dynamic and flexible - changing with the times and the trends. As millennials, we’ve grown up in an interconnected world - the Internet of things allows us to connect to each other with the swipe of a radio button, get notification updates on what’s happening around the world, follow what’s trending on Instagram, start a movement that can be tweeted over and over again within minutes, or cause a company’s stock price to plummet from bad press. For our generation, making money for the sake of money is not enough - for some, it’s not even justified - and businesses need to start looking further than the bottom line. What defines a successful business in this day and age is no longer about how much profit it can make, but rather how much good it can do while making a profit. There are multiple levels of aiming higher and - as hierarchies go - we like to think of these levels as a pyramid of business success. Before climbing up this pyramid, it’s important to first figure out what drives you. Last but definitely not least, our final step to building resiliency is to find your sense of purpose.

                                      <p>
                                        Work harder! Just kidding. A greater focus on accountability and sustainability is a great place to start. Long-term, you should be thinking about how you can make financial returns while also making a social impact (double bottom line), plus an environmental impact (triple bottom line), plus a prioritization of your employee’s well-being (quadruple bottom line). The quadruple bottom line is the goldmine of business success and this is what all businesses should be aiming to achieve. Businesses these days are moving toward these higher levels of the pyramid and, this week, we’re featuring a company that has good intentions but ways to go before achieving multiple bottom lines and a company that does multiple bottom lines well.

                                      <h3>Double bottom line</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        Asa Nordgren, co-founder of Trice Imaging Healthcare, developed a technology (Tricefy) that could share medical images within the Tricefy cloud. The founders recognized the social value in technology that would allow images to be easily transferred between medical professionals, to patients, and eventually be a tool that would increase medical access - and therefore quality of care - for people anywhere and everywhere. Defying the corrupt ecosystem of exclusivity and lack of access so prevalent in pharmaceuticals and medtech, Nordgren had a tough decision with a major deal that would grant a manufacturer exclusivity to Tricefy - she eventually chose to reject the deal and negotiated better terms for Trice. Considering the greater good, i.e. access for impoverished populations - and also the effect that an exclusivity contract would have on the company - Trice rejected the deal. So far, so good right?

                                        The catch appears when you start thinking about measuring social impact. Although the measurement of social impact is still a relatively nascent field, there are certain indicators that can be used to determine positive social impact. In Trice’s case, the company does not follow the diagnoses obtained from the images being transmitted in the Tricefy cloud; it focuses solely on the technology of transmitting images. Is it fair, then, to call Trice a double bottom line type of company? Maybe not… yet. How can they do better for customers who are now more keen to see businesses that have social models? Keep track of how many (accurate) diagnoses patients have received from shared images, for one. In the bigger picture, though, the social impact component should be embedded in the business model. Develop a theory of change. Set clear impact targets. Define your impact indicators.  Test your model and revise.

                                      <h3>Triple bottom line</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        Caue Suplicy, founder of Barnana, is a little quirky - but that’s totally in line with his company’s fourth core value to “be weird and a little different”. His first core value is environmental and social sustainability. Barnana hits the mark on social and environmental impact by supporting local South American workers and raising awareness on decreasing food waste by upcycling imperfect bananas into yummy banana snacks. Financially, Barnana has raised several rounds of funding and has seen increasing annual sales since the company was founded.

                                      <p>
                                        Environmental and social sustainability wasn’t always a part of Barnana’s core values, but Suplicy was able to find a purpose in addressing the problem of food waste - taking into account triple bottom lines to create greater business value. Suplicy has tackled the 3BL pretty well, although he still has one more rung to climb up. While we can only imagine the kind of fun and antics ‘weird and different’ get up to, we aren’t privy to his employees’ job satisfaction and the work happiness at Barnana’s offices; we still need some verification before we can congratulate Suplicy for finding the goldmine.
